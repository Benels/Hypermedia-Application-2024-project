The stalker's behavior is characterized by an obsession with the person receiving this attention and a lack of respect for their autonomy and identity. Often, stalking can lead to more violent behavior. The Stalker A stalker generally exhibits clear issues in emotional-affective, relational, and communicative areas, which do not always correspond to a precise psychopathological framework. Although there is no widely accepted classification of stalker characteristics, some types are suggested by experts in various fields. Five types of stalkers are distinguished by their goals, needs, and desires toward the other person: The \"resentful\" stalker is usually an ex-partner seeking revenge for the breakup, which they perceive as unjust. They harm the person, their image, or property (home, car, etc.). This type posts private photos or images online, waits outside the victim’s home, follows them, or damages their car, justifying their actions by the perceived wrong they believe they've suffered. The \"attention seeker\" is driven by the need to form an emotional relationship with the victim. They interpret any sign of friendliness or familiarity from the victim as a clear expression of desire for contact and emotional closeness, justifying their advances. The \"clumsy suitor\" is socially awkward and inadequate in forming a relationship with the victim, who feels oppressed, \"invaded,\" and attacked. The \"predator\" is motivated by a desire for sexual contact with the victim, with their behavior escalating in response to the victim's fear. The Victim A victim of stalking experiences intense emotions, from initial alertness and psychological stress to pervasive worry, fear for their life, anger and contempt for the stalker, guilt, and shame for what is happening. Their private and personal dimension is violated, and the resulting guilt and shame lead to isolation and withdrawal, reducing requests for help. Victims often develop intense anxiety, sleep disorders, and full-blown psychological conditions, including: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), resulting from emotionally impactful events like death threats, severe injuries, persistent and distressing harassment. Symptoms include intrusive dreams and memories, sensations of reliving the traumatic event, psychological distress in response to similar stimuli, avoidance of trauma-associated stimuli, emotional detachment, and a negative view of the future. Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), resulting from prolonged exposure to trauma, such as repeated physical, emotional, sexual abuse, and maltreatment. Symptoms include difficulty regulating emotions, constant recall of traumatic episodes, changes in self-perception and perception of the stalker, altered relationships, and loss of trust. Somatization, where physical disorders have no organic basis and are closely related to the anxiety and emotional distress experienced by the victim. Sexual aversion, often resulting from stalking incidents involving physical or sexual violence, leading to anxiety, disgust, fear, repulsion, and decreased libido. Dysfunctional coping strategies may include neglecting personal appearance, excessive work or sports, or early bedtimes. Vaginismus, where involuntary contraction of perineal muscles makes intimate relationships painful and nearly impossible. Women and Stalking Gender-based violence is a growing global issue. In Italy, in 2013, 128 women were killed, 83% of whom died in domestic settings. Many more survive physical, sexual, and psychological violence. A 2014 European Union study found that in Italy, 19% of women experienced physical or sexual violence, 38% suffered psychological abuse, and 9% were stalked (mostly by ex-partners). Additionally, 62% of maltreatment incidents occurred in the presence of children. Forms of Stalking: Phone (or virtual) stalking: The compulsive sending of harassing texts or emails and the posting of unpleasant social media posts targeting the victim. Residential stalking: Conduct by a neighbor involving repeated damage to property or obsessive following, leading to constant fear for personal safety. Psychological stalking: Induces persistent and severe anxiety or fear, destabilizing the victim's ordinary life. Legal condemnation for stalking does not require medical evidence of psychological disorders, but it suffices for the victim to report the effects of the harassment to authorities.   Actions for Victims Rationally assess the situation and not underestimate obsessive or inappropriate behaviors. Recognizing the risk early is essential for appropriate response and seeking help if excessive \"attention\" becomes persecution. Be clear about feelings towards the stalker, firmly rejecting invitations and offers, and unequivocally saying \"no\" to unwanted relationships. Any hesitation reinforces the stalker's belief in achieving their goal. Show complete indifference to persecutory behavior, as reacting with anger, fear, or despair can encourage the stalker. Indifference discourages repeated behaviors that fail to elicit a response. Avoid risky situations and locations where the stalker might act, such as isolated or dark places, and frequently change daily routes. Keep a phone handy for immediate calls to law enforcement (113) or emergency services (112). Both numbers are free and available even without credit. Seek medical help after physical assaults, allowing doctors to report the incident to authorities. Maintain a second phone line if harassment occurs by phone, recording all calls from the stalker. Document all persecutory behaviors in a diary, including calls, emails, texts, and letters, to provide a chronological record when filing a complaint. Laws Repeated threats or harassment constitute stalking under Article 612-bis of the Penal Code, requiring multiple occurrences. Court rulings specify that even two incidents of threats or harassment, if causing emotional disruption, are sufficient for prosecution. Punishments range from 6 months to 5 years, with increased penalties if committed by a spouse, ex-spouse, or a person in a sentimental relationship with the victim. Further penalty increases apply in cases involving minors, pregnant women, disabled persons, weapon use, or previous warnings by authorities. Reporting Stalking Victims can request a warning from the police before formally filing a complaint, advising the stalker to desist from harassing behavior. Formal complaints must be filed within 6 months of the incidents. Authorities proceed ex officio (without a complaint) if the victim is a minor, disabled, or if the stalker has been previously warned. Psychotherapeutic Intervention Therapeutic environment must be empathetic and non-judgmental, promoting understanding and trust. Therapeutic treatment should be combined with practical anti-harassment strategies and efforts to maintain or restore social support, reducing secondary stresses that hinder recovery. ####doc_1  \n\n####doc_2 Website content These are the pages: \n1) Services: - medical assistance center <a href=\"/services/5\">link</a>: The Medical Assistance Center, led by Dr Meredith Grey, a gynecologist, provides comprehensive medical care for women affected by violence.
